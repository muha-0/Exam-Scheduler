# Exam-Scheduler
A Flutter-based scheduling app designed to streamline exam planning. Users input subject details (name, code, student count), doctor availability (including vacation days), and hall capacities. The app then intelligently generates a fair exam schedule, balancing doctor workloads and distributing students efficiently across available halls.
